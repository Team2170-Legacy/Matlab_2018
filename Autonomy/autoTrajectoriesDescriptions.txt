From the red side:
Robot moving left makes the robot gain y 
Robot moving right makes the robot lose y
Robot moving straight causes an increase in x
Robot moving backwards causes a decrease in x



*All robots must start against the nearest wall*

Wheel centerline distance
24 7/8 in = 0.6318 m (not 25")

Robot moves 118 3/4 in  on the 120 in move
Encoder error was 20 - 24 counts

Change values to:
Robot.R = 0.0642

Robot.d	= (24 + 7/8)*1.067*in;		% distance between wheel centerlines

Increased further after RSML was short on the move, and slightly under-angled at the end
increase andother 3.3%
Robot.d	= (24 + 7/8)*1.067*1.033*in;		% distance between wheel centerlines

This did NOT improve the move distance much, still a bit short.

Try decreasing Robot.R by 2% to have the robot move 2% further:
Robot.R = 2.5*in  * (118+3/4)/120 / 1.02;         % [m]		Robot wheel radius

with REAL robot:
Straight: 10 ft move: 123 in
Arc: 	> 190 deg

REVERT LAST changes to dimensions! Change back to:
Robot.d	= (24 + 7/8)*1.067*in;              % distance between wheel centerlines
Robot.R = 2.5*in  * (118+3/4)/120;          % [m]		Robot wheel radius

Most likely cause of the robot NOT driving far enough into the switch (6-8 in short)
is a DIMENSIONAL mismatch in the simulator.

Test: Switch left is 8 in short. WHAT WAS THE ABSOLUTE MOVE DISTANCE?
Straight is 121" (1 in over)
Arc is 190 deg, couple inches too far



On 180 deg arc move.
Final angle error is 12 deg, i.e.6.7% off.
Increase simulator spacing by 6.7%,
i.e. 24 7/8 * 1.067

Ignore the Left and Right Starting Positions
Left Starting Position
    - 1.563 ft. away from the closest edge of robot toleft wall

Middle Starting Position
    - 0.5633 ft. away from the closest edge of robot to right side of red exchange zone

Right Starting Position
    - 1.83 ft. away from closest edge of  from right wall

Arc
    - 0 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 10 ft. chnage in y from start to end
    - 180° arc
    - About 1.5 meters on each side of the arc
    - About 3 by 3 meters space used
    - Takes 10-11 seconds
    - Only for robot testing purposes

Straight
    - 10 feet straight forward
    - About 5-6 seconds

RSML
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end

Trial 1: 105 in, 3 in short
Trial 2: 106 in, 2 in short
Trial 3: 10 ft straight move: 10 ft exactly,
so DON'T change wheel R
Increase


    - 6 ft. change in y
    - Goes forward about 1 meter
    - Turns right, about 45°
    - Goes straight, turns right back to original angle
    - Takes about 3 by 4 meters of space
    - 6 seconds

RSMR
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - -3 ft. change in y
    - Goes forward about 1 meters
    - Turns right about 45°
    - Goes straight and returns back to original angle 
    - Takes 2 by 4 space, 6 seconds

BSMR
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 3 ft. change in y
    - Reflection of RSMR, (goes the other way)

BSML
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 6 ft. change in y from start to end
    - Reflection of RSML (goes the other way)

Reviewed field dimensions.
Wrote script "check_Robot_moves_v001" to check the robot move distances.

According to field dimensions, robot should move 105.5 in along x.
Switch is 140 in away from base line.

Our scripts wants to move robot 108.09 in.
This is because the ending position is back calculated from Field.RSwitch.LVT_x
which is more than the 140 in.
Field.RSwitch.LVT_x/in = 142.59
(Field.RSwitch.LVT_x - Robot.L/2 ) /in = 125.34
Ending x-position in RSML trajectory is:
RSML.x(8)/in = 125.34

So it seems the simulator uses a move distance of approx 108 in, which is 2.5 in too far,
which corresponds to the extra 2.5 in in calculation of RMSL.x(8)

BUT

during tests we were 2.5 in short of move distance, I believe 105.5 instead of 108 in,
but this SHOULD HAVE BEEN the correct move distance according to drawings,
but this was 8 in SHORT of our Switch location.... Why????
