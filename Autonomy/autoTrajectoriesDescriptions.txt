From the red side:
Robot moving left makes the robot gain y 
Robot moving right makes the robot lose y
Robot moving straight causes an increase in x
Robot moving backwards causes a decrease in x



*All robots must start against the nearest wall*
Wheel centerline distance
24 7/8 in = 0.6318 m (not 25")

Robot moves 118 3/4 in  on the 120 in move
Encoder error was 20 - 24 counts

Change values to:
Robot.R = 0.0642

Robot.d	= (24 + 7/8)*1.067*in;		% distance between wheel centerlines

Increased further after RSML was short on the move, and slightly under-angled at the end
increase andother 3.3%
Robot.d	= (24 + 7/8)*1.067*1.033*in;		% distance between wheel centerlines

This did NOT improve the move distance much, still a bit short.

Try decreaseing Robot.R by 2% to have the robot move 2% further:
Robot.R = 2.5*in  * (118+3/4)/120 / 1.02;         % [m]		Robot wheel radius



On 180 deg arc move.
Final angle error is 12 deg, i.e.6.7% off.
Increase simulator spacing by 6.7%,
i.e. 24 7/8 * 1.067


Ignore the Left and Right Starting Positions
Left Starting Position
    - 1.563 ft. away from the closest edge of robot toleft wall

Middle Starting Position
    - 0.5633 ft. away from the closest edge of robot to right side of red exchange zone

Right Starting Position
    - 1.83 ft. away from closest edge of  from right wall

Arc
    - 0 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 10 ft. chnage in y from start to end
    - 180° arc
    - About 1.5 meters on each side of the arc
    - About 3 by 3 meters space used
    - Takes 10-11 seconds
    - Only for robot testing purposes

Straight
    - 10 feet straight forward
    - About 5-6 seconds

RSML
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end

Trial 1: 105 in, 3 in short
Trial 2: 106 in, 2 in short
Trial 3: 10 ft straight move: 10 ft exactly,
so DON'T change wheel R
Increase


    - 6 ft. change in y
    - Goes forward about 1 meter
    - Turns right, about 45°
    - Goes straight, turns right back to original angle
    - Takes about 3 by 4 meters of space
    - 6 seconds

RSMR
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - -3 ft. change in y
    - Goes forward about 1 meters
    - Turns right about 45°
    - Goes straight and returns back to original angle 
    - Takes 2 by 4 space, 6 seconds

BSMR
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 3 ft. change in y
    - Reflection of RSMR, (goes the other way)

BSML
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 6 ft. change in y from start to end
    - Reflection of RSML (goes the other way)
