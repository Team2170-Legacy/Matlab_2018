From the red side:
Robot moving left makes the robot gain y 
Robot moving right makes the robot lose y
Robot moving straight causes an increase in x
Robot moving backwards causes a decrease in x



*All robots must start against the nearest wall*

Ignore the Left and Right Starting Positions
Left Starting Position
    - 1.563 ft. away from the closest edge of robot toleft wall

Middle Starting Position
    - 0.5633 ft. away from the closest edge of robot to right side of red exchange zone

Right Starting Position
    - 1.83 ft. away from closest edge of  from right wall

Arc
    - 0 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 10 ft. chnage in y from start to end
    - 180° arc
    - About 1.5 meters on each side of the arc
    - About 3 by 3 meters space used
    - Takes 10-11 seconds
    - Only for robot testing purposes

Straight
    - 10 feet straight forward
    - About 5-6 seconds

RSML
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 3 ft. change in y
    - Goes forward about 1 meter
    - Turns right, about 45°
    - Goes straight, turns right back to original angle
    - Takes about 3 by 4 meters of space
    - 6 seconds

RSMR
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 3 ft. change in y
    - Goes forward about 9 meters
    - Turns right about 45°
    - Goes straight and returns back to original angle 
    - Takes 2 by 4 space, 6 seconds

BSMR
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 3 ft. change in y
    - Reflection of RSMR, (goes the other way)

BSML
    - 9.0019 ft. change in x from start to end
    - 6 ft. change in y from start to end
    - Reflection of RSML (goes the other way)
