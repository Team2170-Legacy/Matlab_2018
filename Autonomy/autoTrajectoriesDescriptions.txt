Arc 
- 0 ft change in x from start to end
- 10 ft chnage in y from start to end
- 180 degree arc
- about 1.5 meters on each side of the arc
- about 3 by 3 meters space used
- takes 10-11 seconds
- only for robot testing purposes

Straight
- 10 feet straight forward
- About 5-6 seconds

RSML
