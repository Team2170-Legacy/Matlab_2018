1) Why did the robot for the 2nd cube switch v2 not approach
straight from the back as in the movie but more at a 45 deg angle?

2) What is the best way to specify the add_x & add_y corrections
to those move if the robot comes in at the 45 deg angle?
Currently, we use two additions to the final points with /sqrt(2)
coefficients to adjust the final trajectory point.

3) For the 2nd cube switch auto, the last Forward moved seemed to have 
trouble in the simulator.
Does it use the nominal end point of the previous trajectory
as it's start point or does it use the adjusted one?
For large adjustments, we may need to adjust the start point by the same amount.
Or, for such a short move, just go from the nominal end point of the
last trajectory and don't use any adjustments.

One challenge is that this trajectory is slow.
May need a custom higher Kp gain for this trajectory ONLY
to speed it up.

It seems we need to smooth out the trajectories and remove
sharp velocity changes, like e.g. in the 2ndCubeLeftSwitch.
The robot doesn't seem to be able to follow these,
and these sharp changes may exist in other profiles as well...
